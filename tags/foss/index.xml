      <description>This has been the second year I went to FOSDEM. Is a great conference to learn, get together with friends that are spread across the world and enjoy Open Source.
Being there and seeing the awesome things people were doing made me think about my last contributions to the community and how shy they are. A lot of times I&amp;rsquo;ve rejected contributing to a project or publishing a project or a library I&amp;rsquo;m working on due its early stage or the idea of the code or the approach &amp;ldquo;not being good enough&amp;rdquo;.</description>
